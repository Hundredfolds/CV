## Edward Phillips

I am a junior developer, looking for new opportunities to continue to grow my skills and knowledge while working with good people building great products.

I learned to code at the Makers Academy, a london based bootcamp, which has led me to my current role, working at [Twine](https://twine.net/) as a junior fullstack developer.

# Review

Want to see how I work? The table below has links to recorded programming sessions where I go in blind, talk to a 'client' to determine what the specifications of the program they want and test drive a solution to meet those specifications.

# Skills


### Quick Learner
At Makers I learned the value in choosing the right tools for the job, from appreciating the power of the basics in building a [news summary dashboard](#projects) using just simple HTML, CSS and Javascript, to how to use the MERN stack for the first time in my final project, [WhatStack](#projects), a realtime messaging platform for developers. More recently, following a devops issue in our cloud environment, I have gained experience with AWS and have acquired the Cloud Practitioner certification with plans to take the associate solutions architect certification in the near future. 

### User-Centric Problem Solver
At Twine when working on a ticket I ensure that I understand the user story behind the work, so that I can work on a solution that meets the acceptance criteria of the ticket while also being confident that the user story has been fully satisfied.

### Team Player
While working in a startup I frequently took on other work from across the company, ranging from: building customer growth models for the marketing team; optimizing the packaging process for the in-house pharmacy; and structuring spreadsheets so that google form responses were displayed in a meaningful to the user whilst also restricting access to certain data for compliance reasons.

### **Zavamed** (Feb 2017 to Jan 2020)    
*Accounts Assistant* (Mar 2018 to Jan 2020)
- Working in the finance team allowed me to understand how the company's overarching aims were applied in practice and also taught me the importance of OKRs as I became responsible for planning and tracking the finance teams OKRs for more than a year and a half. From this I recognised the value that having a metric delivers and how important it is to connect the work you do on a day to day basis not only to your team goals but also the wider goals and mission of the company.

*Senior Customer Support Advisor* (Jun 2017 to Mar 2018)
- A new role was created for me to recognise the expertise I had developed in customer communication and problem resolution, this led to me becoming responsible for the onboarding training of new team members and mentoring and supporting a team of seven.

# Hobbies
I am an origami enthusiast, inspired largely by the work of Eric Joisel.
I'm also an avid fan of science fiction, particularly the works of Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut.
I can solve a 3x3 rubik's cube reasonably quickly (average under 2 minutes).
